# LPI-SKMSC
LPI-SKMSC was a clustering-based lncRNA-protein interactions(LPIs) prediction method using segmented k-mer frequencies and multi-space clustering. It was dedicated to handling the imbalance of positive and negative samples.

The current code is the test part of LPI-SKMSC. Predictive metrics can be obtained by testing the trained model. The complete code will be submitted after the paper is accepted.
